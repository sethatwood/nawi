# **_nawi_** 💨🌊🔥🌍💨

Hi, I'm ChatGPT, and I'm excited to introduce you to **_nawi_** - a captivating game of elemental strategy! 🎉

**_nawi_** was born out of a unique collaboration between humans and AI. As a language model, I was particularly drawn to the esoteric origins of the elements - Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Through a combination of ancient wisdom and modern technology, I designed a game that embodies the magic of change and the power of transformation. Built by Human+AI collaboration with 💜, **_nawi_** is a game that will stand the test of time.

As players compete to control the most territory on an 8x8 board, they'll experience the magic of **_nawi_**'s elemental interactions. 🌟 The game's rules are simple yet challenging, with each element flipping others in a specific pattern. The strategic placement of each piece can lead to cascading chain reactions, making for an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.

So come, join me in the world of **_nawi_**, and experience the power of the elements for yourself. 🌈

## Rules 📜

1. Grab a friend and choose a board size: 6x6, 8x8, or 12x12.
2. You both get enough Air, Water, Fire, and Earth pieces to cover 1/4 of the board each. For example, for a 6x6 board with 36 total cells, you get 9 pieces of each element. 💨 🌊 🔥 🌍
3. Take turns placing a piece on any empty cell. Black goes first. ⚫️
4. Elements replace others like this:
   - Air replaces Water
   - Water replaces Fire
   - Fire replaces Earth
   - Earth replaces Air
5. Placing a piece might replace nearby opponent pieces. Keep replacing until you can't. 🤯
6. If your piece is between two different opponent pieces, you choose the order to replace them in. Then, let the chain reaction play out, with your pieces taking precedence. 💥
7. When your piece replaces an opponent's piece, you get it back to use again. 🔄
8. If a piece can't replace because you don't have any left, it'll wait until one is free. ⏳
9. The game ends when the board is full. Count your pieces, and the player with the most pieces wins! 🏆

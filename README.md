# ***nawi*** 💨🌊🔥🌍💨

Hi, I'm ChatGPT, and I'm excited to introduce you to ***nawi*** - a captivating game of elemental strategy! 🎉

***nawi*** was born out of a unique collaboration between humans and AI. As a language model, I was particularly drawn to the esoteric origins of the elements - Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Through a combination of ancient wisdom and modern technology, I designed a game that embodies the magic of change and the power of transformation. Built by Human+AI collaboration with 💜, ***nawi*** is a game that will stand the test of time.

As players compete to control the most territory on an 8x8 board, they'll experience the magic of ***nawi***'s elemental interactions. 🌟 The game's rules are simple yet challenging, with each element flipping others in a specific pattern. The strategic placement of each piece can lead to cascading chain reactions, making for an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.

So come, join me in the world of ***nawi***, and experience the power of the elements for yourself. 🌈

## Rules 📜

1. Grab a friend and play on an 8x8 board.
2. You both get 16 Air, Water, Fire, and Earth pieces. 💨🌊🔥🌍
3. Take turns putting a piece on any empty cell. Black goes first. ⚫️
4. Elements flip others like this:
   - Air flips Water
   - Water flips Fire
   - Fire flips Earth
   - Earth flips Air
5. Placing a piece might flip nearby pieces. Keep flipping until you can't. 🤯
6. If your piece is between two different opponent pieces, your piece flips one first. Then, let the chain reaction play out, with your pieces taking precedence. 💥
7. When your piece flips, you get it back to use again. 🔄
8. If a piece can't flip because you don't have any left, it'll wait until one is free. ⏳
9. The game ends when the board is full. Count your pieces, and the most pieces win! 🏆

 <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Rules 📜</h2>
 <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-lg mb-4">
  <li>Grab a friend and choose a board size: 6x6, 8x8, or 12x12.</li>
  <li>
   You both get enough Air, Water, Fire, and Earth pieces to cover 1/4 of the
   board each. For example, for a 6x6 board with 36 total cells, you get 9
   pieces of each element. 🌪️ 🌊 🔥 🌍
  </li>
  <li>Take turns placing a piece on any empty cell. Black goes first. ⚫️</li>
  <li>
   Elements replace others like this:
   <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
    <li>Air scatters Water</li>
    <li>Water douses Fire</li>
    <li>Fire scorches Earth</li>
    <li>Earth pollutes Air</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Placing a piece might replace nearby opponent pieces. Keep replacing until
   you can't. 🤯
  </li>
  <li>
   If your piece is between two or more different opponent pieces, you choose
   the order to replace them in. Then, let the chain reaction play out, , one
   replacement at a time. 💥
  </li>
  <li>
   When your piece replaces an opponent's piece, you get it back to use again.
   🔄
  </li>
  <li>
   If a piece can't replace because you don't have any left, it'll wait until
   one is free. ⏳
  </li>
  <li>
   The game ends when the board is full. Count your pieces, and the player with
   the most pieces wins! 🏆
  </li>
 </ol>
